The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have
been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and
occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to
categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in
to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad,
5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The train.csv contains two columns, "emotion" and
"pixels". The "emotion" column contains a numeric code ranging from 0 to 6,
inclusive, for the emotion that is present in the image. The "pixels" column
contains a string surrounded in quotes for each image. The contents of this
string a space-separated pixel values in row major order. test.csv contains
only the "pixels" column and your task is to predict the emotion column.

The training set consists of 28,709 examples. The public test set used for
the leaderboard consists of 3,589 examples. The final test set, which was
used to determine the winner of the competition, consists of another 3,589
examples.

This dataset was prepared by Pierre-Luc Carrier and Aaron Courville, as part
of an ongoing research project. They have graciously provided the workshop
organizers with a preliminary version of their dataset to use for this contest.
